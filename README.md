ROS2 geophysical navigation simulation.


## notes

**2025-01-09**: As of today, I have been able to successfully get basic command-line ROS2 Jazzy up and running in a development container via VS Code as per the settings and configuration in the `.devcontainer` folder. However, for some reason, I cannont get GUI applications (namely RViz2 and Gazebo) to run. RViz2 appears to hang on initialization. Gazebo appears like it can run as the backend engine isn't GUI-based so that might be ok. However, as a developer sanity check, it might still be useful to have RViz2 running. I unfortuneately killed a day on this when I should have been doing bathy pf work. So I'm going to leave it there for now.
